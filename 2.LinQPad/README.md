This folder contains the LinQPad files used to make a quick overview of the model to create the actual Data Model.

In order to understand this ISO20022 model in full, or at least understanding the relationships between each of the components, the PocUnderstandingIso.linq has been created.
The idea is to build a visual displayable model structure based on the .iso20022 file. There is a lot of nodes in the full file, which makes it more unreadable. To understand how they interact with eachother and why they link to eachother in the way they do, a target message has been selected. Pain.001.001.03 has been selected and the first file has been trimmed down to its basics needs (pain.001.001.03_version_eRepository.iso20022). This one should contain only the basic needs for actually making or generating an actual C# class representitive model of the pain.001.001.03 message. 

This is great, but why do the full eRepository have so much more information hidden within it? The pain.001.001.03_version_eRepository_Extended.iso20022 tries to uncover this, by actually adding some of the other components, which are referenced to from the slim model. It turns out it works in a shadow world i.e. the Business-world. So the eRepository consists of both sides of a coin (so to speak); on the one side one got the Message Model Structure and on the other side the Business Model Structure. They are basically the same, but it might be that there can be some additional information to fetch from the business side, which could benefit as notes on the message side (or the future generated C# class model).

The idea of these Proof of Concepts are to generate the logic to actually extract all the wanted information about the future generated classes and keep it in a Object-based model. This model should then be able to be fed into the generator and then a full generated C# class model is generated in the decired way.
