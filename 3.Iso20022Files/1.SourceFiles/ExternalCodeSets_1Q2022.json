This balance is not used if the account’s Earnings Credit Rate is net of reserves. This may be used when the earnings allowance rate is not adjusted for reserves. It may be that reserves have been subtracted from the collected balance to determine the investable balance. Therefore, they must be added back to the excess/(deficit) investable balance to determine the collected balance position. The presentation of this calculation is optional. AFP code=00 04 21\n*`BEQU_bal_equivalent`-Balance required to offset the current analysis period’s balance compensable service charges. The balance equivalent can be calculated in two different ways. The first simply multiplies the balance compensable service charge total by the multiplier.  The second calculation incorporates all of the elements of the multiplier calculation. Note that this calculation may result in a slightly different value due to the decimal precision and rounding used in the calculation: AFP code=00 04 00\n*`CBAM_collected_bal_avg_negative`-The sum of only the daily ending NEGATIVE collected balances divided by the number of days in the statement period. The average negative balance, if present, is always positively signed. Balances are net of current period adjustments.

Note that a NEGATIVE Collected Balance Interest Rate can be applied to this balance to develop an OD interest charge. AFP code=00 00 13\n*`CBAN_collected_bal_avg_net`-The sum of the daily ending collected balances (both positive and negative) divided by the number of days in the statement period.  A negative-signed value indicates a negative average NET balance.  If a reserve-adjusted earnings allowance/credit rate is used, this balance may be the same as the investable balance (00 00 40).  Balances are net of current period adjustments. Collected balances represent deposit money that has been collected and excludes any money in float. Note that a NET balance is equal to the POSITIVE balance less the NEGATIVE balance. Note that a NET Collected Balance OD Interest Rate (00 01 43) can be applied to this balance, if negative, to develop an OD interest charge.

If negative (deficit), this represents the additional investable balance required to fully offset balance compensable service charges for the current period.  If positive (excess), this represents the investable balance surplus after offsetting balance compensable service charges for the current period. Depending on the type of underlying account, a hard interest rate may be applied to a balance excess resulting in a hard interest credit to the underlying account.
